## ✨ Features

| Terminal (TUI) | Mobile Web | Menu Bar |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| Real-time session monitoring | Monitor from your smartphone | Glanceable status in macOS menu bar |
| Quick tab focus with keyboard | Remote terminal focus | Click to focus terminal |
| Vim-style navigation | Send messages to terminal | No screen space required |
| Simple status display | Permission prompt navigation | Auto-updates on session changes |
| | Screen capture with pinch zoom | |

- 🔌 **Serverless** - File-based state management, no API server required
- ⚡ **Easy Setup** - One command `ccm` for automatic setup and launch
- 🔒 **Secure** - No external data transmission, token-based mobile auth

---

## 📋 Requirements

> **Note**: This tool is **macOS only** due to its use of AppleScript for terminal control.

- **macOS**
- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **Claude Code** installed
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (for menu bar feature only - `xcode-select --install`)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run with npx (no install required)

```bash
npx claude-code-monitor
```

### Or install globally

```bash
npm install -g claude-code-monitor
ccm
```

On first run, it automatically sets up hooks and launches the monitor.

### Mobile Access

1. Press `h` to show QR code (default port: 3456)
2. Scan with your smartphone (same Wi-Fi required)

> If port 3456 is in use, an available port is automatically selected.

### Remote Access with Tailscale

Access from anywhere using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) (secure VPN).

**Prerequisites:**
1. Install Tailscale on your Mac and smartphone
2. Sign in with the same Tailscale account on both devices
3. Ensure Tailscale is connected (check menu bar icon)

```bash
# Start with Tailscale IP
npx claude-code-monitor -t

# Or if installed globally
ccm -t
```

With `-t` option, the QR code URL uses your Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x), allowing access from any device in your Tailnet - even outside your local network.

> **Security**: Tailscale uses WireGuard encryption. Communication is secure even over public networks.

## 📱 Mobile Web Interface

Monitor and control Claude Code sessions from your smartphone.

### Features

- Real-time session status via WebSocket
- View latest Claude messages
- Focus terminal sessions remotely
- Send text messages to terminal (multi-line supported)
- **Permission prompt navigation** - Respond to permission dialogs remotely
  - Direction pad for arrow keys (up/down/left/right) and Enter
  - Screen capture to view terminal state
  - Pinch zoom (1x-5x) for captured screenshots
- Swipe-to-close gesture on modal
- Warning display for dangerous commands

### Security

> **Important**: Your smartphone and Mac must be on the **same Wi-Fi network** (or use Tailscale with `-t` option for remote access).

- **Token Authentication** - A unique token is generated for authentication
- **Local Network Only** - Not accessible from the internet
- **Do not share the URL** - Treat it like a password

**Recommended networks:**
- Home Wi-Fi
- Office/Work Wi-Fi

> **Warning**: Avoid using on public Wi-Fi networks (cafes, airports, etc.). Other users on the same network could potentially access your monitor.

## 🖥️ Menu Bar Monitor

A native macOS menu bar item that shows session status at a glance without taking up any screen space.

### Launch

```bash
ccm menubar
# Or with alias
ccm m
```

To run the terminal UI and menu bar together:

```bash
ccm --menubar
# Or
ccm watch --menubar
```

On first run, the Swift source is compiled and cached. Subsequent launches are instant (recompiles only when the source changes).

### Display

| State | Menu Bar |
|-------|----------|
| No sessions | `CCM` |
| 2 running, 1 waiting | `● 2  ◐ 1` |
| 1 running, 1 waiting, 3 stopped | `● 1  ◐ 1  ✓ 3` |

Zero-count statuses are omitted to keep the display compact.

### Dropdown Menu

Click the menu bar item to see individual sessions. Click a session to focus its terminal window.

### Stop

```bash
ccm menubar-stop
```

### Requirements

- Xcode Command Line Tools (`swiftc` must be available)
- If not installed: `xcode-select --install`

## 🖥️ Supported Terminals

| Terminal | Focus Support | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| iTerm2 | ✅ Full | TTY-based window/tab targeting |
| Terminal.app | ✅ Full | TTY-based window/tab targeting |
| Ghostty | ✅ Full | Title-based window targeting via Window menu |

> Other terminals can use monitoring, but focus feature is not supported.

### Ghostty Users

For reliable focus functionality with multiple tabs, `ccm` or `ccm setup` will prompt you to add the following setting:

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_TERMINAL_TITLE": "1"
  }
}
```

This prevents Claude Code from overwriting terminal titles, which is necessary for tab identification in Ghostty.

If you skipped this during setup and want to enable it later, add the setting manually or delete `CLAUDE_CODE_MONITOR_GHOSTTY_ASKED` from your settings and run `ccm` again.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### `ccm` command not found

If hooks are configured but sessions don't appear, the `ccm` command may not be installed or on your PATH. Verify with:

```bash
which ccm
```

To fix, install globally:

```bash
npm install -g claude-code-monitor
```

Or if developing locally, build and link:

```bash
npm install && npm run build && npm link
```

### Sessions not showing

1. Run `ccm setup` to verify hook configuration
2. Check `~/.claude/settings.json` for hook settings
3. Restart Claude Code

### "Waiting for input" status not appearing

If the monitor doesn't show the waiting/permission prompt status, check the Notification hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`. It should **not** have a `"matcher"` field:

```json
// ✅ Correct — matches all notification types including permission_prompt
"Notification": [
  {
    "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "ccm hook Notification" }]
  }
]

// ❌ Wrong — empty matcher prevents permission_prompt from being detected
"Notification": [
  {
    "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "ccm hook Notification" }],
    "matcher": ""
  }
]
```

If your config has `"matcher": ""` on the Notification hook, remove it and restart Claude Code. Running `ccm setup` with v1.3.2+ will configure this correctly.

### Focus not working

1. Verify you're using a supported terminal
2. Check System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
   - Ensure your terminal app has Accessibility permission

### Reset data

```bash
ccm clear
```

## 🔒 Security

> **Warning**: Without Tailscale, this tool is designed for use on **trusted private networks only**.
>
> **Never use on public Wi-Fi** (cafes, airports, hotels, co-working spaces, etc.) without Tailscale.
> Other users on the same network could potentially intercept the authentication token
> and gain control of your terminal sessions, including the ability to execute arbitrary commands.

- **No data sent to external servers** - All data stays on your machine
- Hook registration modifies `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Focus feature uses AppleScript for terminal control
- Mobile Web uses token authentication on local network only
- Server-side validation blocks dangerous shell commands

### Secure Remote Access

For secure access from outside your local network, use the `-t` (Tailscale) option:

| Mode | Network | Security |
|------|---------|----------|
| Default | Same Wi-Fi only | Home/Office Wi-Fi recommended |
| `-t` (Tailscale) | Anywhere in Tailnet | WireGuard encrypted, safe on any network |

With Tailscale, communication is encrypted end-to-end, making it safe to use even on public Wi-Fi (cafes, airports, etc.).
