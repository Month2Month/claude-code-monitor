## ✨ Features

- 🔌 **Serverless** - File-based session state management (no API server required)
- 🔄 **Real-time** - Auto-updates on file changes
- 🎯 **Tab Focus** - Instantly switch to the terminal tab of a selected session
- 🎨 **Simple UI** - Displays only status and directory
- ⚡ **Easy Setup** - One command `ccm` for automatic setup and launch

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS** (focus feature is macOS only)
- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **Claude Code** installed

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Global install (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g claude-code-monitor
```

### Run with npx (no install required)

```bash
npx claude-code-monitor
```

> **Note**: With npx, you must run `npx claude-code-monitor` each time (the `ccm` shortcut is only available with global install). Global install is recommended since this tool requires hook setup and is designed for continuous use.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
ccm
```

On first run, it automatically sets up hooks and launches the monitor.

---

## 🖥️ Supported Terminals

Focus feature works with the following terminals:

| Terminal | Focus Support | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| iTerm2 | ✅ Full | TTY-based window/tab targeting |
| Terminal.app | ✅ Full | TTY-based window/tab targeting |
| Ghostty | ⚠️ Limited | Activates app only (cannot target specific window/tab) |

> **Note**: Other terminals (Alacritty, kitty, Warp, etc.) can use monitoring but focus feature is not supported.

---

## 💾 Data Storage

Session data is stored in `~/.claude-monitor/sessions.json`.

### What is stored

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `session_id` | Claude Code session identifier |
| `cwd` | Working directory path |
| `tty` | Terminal device path (e.g., `/dev/ttys001`) |
| `status` | Session status (running/waiting_input/stopped) |
| `updated_at` | Last update timestamp |

Data is automatically removed after 30 minutes of inactivity or when the terminal session ends.

---

## 📦 Programmatic Usage

Can also be used as a library:

```typescript
import { getSessions, getStatusDisplay } from 'claude-code-monitor';

const sessions = getSessions();
for (const session of sessions) {
  const { symbol, label } = getStatusDisplay(session.status);
  console.log(`${symbol} ${label}: ${session.cwd}`);
}
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Sessions not showing

1. Run `ccm setup` to verify hook configuration
2. Check if `~/.claude/settings.json` contains hook settings
3. Restart Claude Code

```bash
# Check configuration
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep ccm
```

### Focus not working

1. Verify you're using macOS
2. Verify you're using iTerm2, Terminal.app, or Ghostty
3. Check System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Accessibility permissions

### Reset session data

```bash
ccm clear
# or
rm ~/.claude-monitor/sessions.json
```

---

## 🔒 Security

- This tool modifies `~/.claude/settings.json` to register hooks
- Focus feature uses AppleScript to control terminal applications
- All data is stored locally; no network requests are made
